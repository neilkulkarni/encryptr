# encryptr

### Inspiration
We were inspired to add another level of security to people's data. When people share laptops or common accounts, their personal data may be vulnerable and no longer private. By encrypting your files, you can ensure that you are the only person reading your files.

### What It Does
Our program encrypts and decrypts local text files to ensure that the contents of your files are protected. Users select the file that they want encrypted and decrypted through a file chooser, and then simply enter a key word for the process to be completed. The decrypted or encrypted file is then available for the user to access.

### What It Uses
The project uses symmetric cryptography to encrypt and decrypt the data. We first wrote a sorting algorithm using a Vign√®re cipher that uses the basis of a keyword to shift the letters in a given file. Then, we created a graphical user interface for users to interact with the program.

### What's Next?
The next step is to implement our project through Microsoft Azure so that it can be available as a Java web application. Additionally, we can look into different methods of encryption or encrypting multiple files at once. Finally, we would be interested in adding feature that let you upload your encrypted file to the cloud automatically, for instance to Google Drive.
